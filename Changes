0.41    2016-04-01  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Removed] select-org-elements is renamed to 'orgsel' and spun off to
          its own distro (App-orgsel).

        - [Removed] Remove 'cache_dir' option because Org::Parser 0.47 uses a
          default cache directory (~/.cache/perl-org-parser). Caching can be
          enabled by setting PERL_ORG_PARSER_CACHE=1, but App::OrgUtils enables
          this by default unless user specifically turns off caching using

0.29    2015-04-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Incompatible change] Rename back 'file' argument to 'files' as
	  they are more suitable as function argument, and anyway CLI
	  option name will become singular automatically using the new
	  Perinci::Sub::GetArgs::Argv.


0.28    2015-04-01  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add scripts: list-org-priorities, list-org-tags,
	  list-org-todo-states.

        - [Incompatible change] Rename 'files' argument to 'file' so it's nicer
          for CLI script ('--file blah --file another' instead of '--files blah
          --files another').

	  arithmetics because that will expose previous bug of timezone
	  difference.

	- [Bugfix] Fix date calculation: make sure today() also uses the
	  same timezone, otherwise epoch arithmetics possible will yield <
	  86400 even though date differs by 1 day.

         - Switch CLI scripts from using Perinci::CmdLine to
           Perinci::CmdLine::Any to reduce size of dependencies.


0.21    2014-03-08  Released-By: SHARYANTO

          wrapper code.

0.16    2013-01-09  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - list-org-headlines: Allow due_in to be undef, which will use warning
          period, or 14 days. So todo items with warning period of 1 day, for
          example, won't show up too early.


0.15    2012-07-25  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Fix outputing Unicode text when format=text [RT #78490].

        - list-org-headlines: Add 'cache_dir' option. UPDATE: this option has
          been removed because Org::Parser 0.47+ selects a default cache
          directory.


0.13    2012-06-13  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        No functional changes. Properly name the POD of scripts [RT#77794].

        - Add 'group_by_tags' option.


0.11    2012-03-02  Released-By: SHARYANTO

0.09    2011-11-11  Released-By: SHARYANTO

          a default (UTC) when $ENV{TZ} is not set.
